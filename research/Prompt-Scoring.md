Forms of Summarization

- Unbiased generic summarization
- Domain-specific summarization where the model uses domain information to form a more accuracte summary based on known facts (**Similar to what is needed for MI Style Summarization?**)
- Query-based summarization whereby the summary contains answers to NL questions about the input text

## Evaluation

**ROUGE:** A group of precision and recall metrics can are used to compare system and reference summaries.

- ROUGE-N measures the N-overlap between system and reference
- ROUGE-L measures the longest matching sequence of words
