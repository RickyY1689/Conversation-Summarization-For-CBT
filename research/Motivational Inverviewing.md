Questions This Week

- General understanding of the current system at play
  - How my system will work within it all
  - Access to the data transcript to look through
- Building the model
  - Will this be from scratch
  - Any resources?

- Clarrification on Thesis
  - Just make sure Rose is aware this is a full year course



## Things to Get Done

- Read the book 
- Check the grad doc and go through the training modules
- Go through some example transcripts and hand summarize them within the principles of MI 
- Do an MI summary, there is a guiding component in what you summarize, omit things that are counter/unproductive, highlight things that are productive 
  - Selection is referred to as what to include and what to omit
- Create an MI **adherant** summary
- Take a look at the GPT3 paper "few shot [something something]"
- 90 mins after you smoke a cigarette you're suffering from withdrawl
- Immediate interview then a followup then another a week later after the 5 questions are asked by the chat
  - Measured by how many people make quit attempts comparred to prior to the experiment
- Set goals, send a follow-up email afterwards along with things I will aim to get done
- In each meeting, catch Rose up on what we're doing, what I've done (**CONCRETE THINGS**) that I can show along with what issues I ran into + future tasks, do ask for advice on these things though

## Notes on Chapter 1

- MI involved attention to natural language about change, with implications for how to have more effective conversations about it
- Most conversations are initiated with the best of intentions but occur in a dysfunctional way
- Conversation lies on a spectrum
  - One one end directing
  - One the other following
  - In the middle sits guiding style
- MI follows a "guiding" style

- Often with helpers there is a "righting reflex", the desire to fix what seems wrong with people, relying particularly on directing

### **THE RIGHTING REFLEX**

- Most common issue with people who need to make a change is ambivalence, but this is one step closer to change

## Summarizing Specific Notes

- Essentially reflections
  - Simple Reflections: Repeats what was said
  - Complex Reflections: Links to something
    - Links to something that's known and might take the person to a direction that's useful
    - Backwards looking reflection, relate to something that was said a while ago
- Typically adding a "what else" will invite more discussion
- Types of Summaries
  - Collecting: Done after the client lists something out
  - Linking: Reflect what the client has said and relate it to something mentioned in a prior conversation
  - Transitional: Wrap up a task or session by pulling together what seems important or announce a shift to something new
- Summaries differ from reflections as typically reflections are done immediately after the client responds to a question
- Summaries pull together things from a longer conversation building to a "whole picture" quality, these qualities all come from the client but their combination should offer something new
  - ie. juxtaposing two things, highlighting and relating things said
- "see the whole picture of the forest in a way that wasnâ€™t clear from examining one tree at a time"
- Chapter 14 seems to mention moving from a position of ambivalence to a position of direction, is direction something we want to potentially incorporate into our summaries?

## General Notes

- Should the summarization stage be seen as the "planning" stage or is it rather a holistic evaluation of the first climb of these set of stairs 

  - Feels the questions aim to cover the four building blocks: planning, focusing, evoking, planning

- Is there anything planned after the summarization, ie a call to action, "what else"?

- Spirit of MI![image-20221012135758857](Book Notes.assets/image-20221012135758857.png)

- Avoid labling, reframe the situation and approach with a patient first mentality

  - if they want to label themselves they can, but no need to get into debates about labeling

- Avoid blaming

- Avoid focusing too early

  - Should the summarizer focus or expand on the answers?

- Questions/areas to help engagement

- DO NOT ACT LIKE YOU ARE BETTER THAN THE CLIENT

  ![image-20221011183100871](Book Notes.assets/image-20221011183100871.png)

- Should the summarizer contain reflective statements

- Should the summarizer focus on something it feels is indicative of the root problem

- Reflective listening focuses on the client's narrative rather than imposing your own

- Simple reflections add little or nothing to what the patient has said
- ![image-20221011184943930](Book Notes.assets/image-20221011184943930.png)
- If a reflection grows long, remember that the person is most likely to respond to what you said last
- you decide what to reflect and what to ignore, what to emphasize or de-emphasize, and what words to use in capturing meaning. Reflection can therefore be used to shine a light on certain aspects of what a person has said or to reframe its meaning slightly.

- Summary should include some affirmation?
