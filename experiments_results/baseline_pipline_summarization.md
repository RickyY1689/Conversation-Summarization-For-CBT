Primary Takeaways

- Some results are really promising and serve as the mvp for this type of summarization task
- Major issues involve the following
  - Despite some attempts at tweaking the gpt3 prompts, some summarizations still mention the bot or the user which detracts from the summarization and the immersion of the conversation
    - Could potentially try resolving through simple text parsing algorithms to replace bot/user with their respective pronouns
  - Certain summarizations result in "I think" type sentences which - somewhat amusingly - result in the righting error pitfall
    - Could also try resolving through text parsing/cleaning but may be circumvented through more cleaver prompts or a reframing of the problem



Remember that GPT-3 can also be used as a classifier

- Ie. Is there a "righting reflex" buried within the text
-
